## Building Firmware

Various sizes and thumb-cluster styles are supported as keymaps. To build the firmware, use the command:
`qmk compile -kb cyboard/dactyl -km {THUMB STYLE}_{ROWS}`
where `{THUMB STYLE}` can be `manuform`, `dualarcs`, or `singlearc`
and `{ROWS}` can be `function_row`, `number_row`, or `letters_only`

## Flashing

To flash the firmware to your Cyboard,
1. Enter the bootloader by double-tapping the reset button on the back of the board, next to the USB port.
2. A USB device called `RPI-RP2` should appear on your computer.
3. Drag the `.uf2` firmware file into `RPI-RP2`.  `RPI-RP2` should now disappear, and your Cyboard is ready to use with your new firmware!
